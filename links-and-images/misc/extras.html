    <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
    <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You
   should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>
   <!-- entities always start with & and end with ;. Start with and sign then end with semicolon -->
   <p>If you&rsquo;re into web &ldquo;typography,&rdquo;you&rsquo;ll also find yourself using curly quotes quite a bit  </p>
